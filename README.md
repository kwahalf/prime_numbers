# prime_numbers This code produces prime numbers  in the range of values provided 

In mathematics, prime numbers are those whole numbers greater than 1, whose factors are 1 and the number itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7 are some prime numbers.

In my program, I have also included a timer() function to find the time complexity.
